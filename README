If you were using "new_rails" before Rails 2.2 introduced the 
project templating DSL, you we a pretty smart developer. If you're 
STILL using new_rails, then you're missing out on a sweet project
definition language. 

Check out the fasteragile.rb template for details. 

If you're doing this: 

  utils/new_rails myproject

STOP! Do this instead: 

  rails myproject -m utils/fasteragile.rb

Or, even better: 

 rails myproject -m intridea.rb
